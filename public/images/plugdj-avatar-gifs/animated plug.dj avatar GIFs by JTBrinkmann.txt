Upon popular requests (2) I made GIFs of the plug.dj avatars (all avatars since summer 2014). There are 267 avatars in 4 variations (standing, standing cropped, dancing, DJing). Sadly, Imgur didn't like me uploading 267x4 gifs (75MB), so I uploaded them to Dropbox instead. Dropbox doesn't seem to offer an animated preview of the gifs, so you actually need to select and download them and open them again (e.g. drag'n'drop into your browsers tabbar) to look at them. (click the blue download button in the top-right to download a gif / folder)

You might be able to use them as profile pictures on some pages, which is also why I made cropped standing gifs (bc i think they make good profile pics)

Update: I added the avatars plug used from 2012 to 2014 (sadly I don't have the halloween/winter specials, please contact me if **you** do)

btw, looking for a simple but good Windows GIF viewer? I recommend http://sourceforge.net/projects/gifviewer/
